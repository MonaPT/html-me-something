            <p>I love books. "I love that moment when you open one and sink into it, you can escape from the world, into a story that is way more interesting than your's will ever be." I can totally relate to it. Can't agree more. A good book is a fascinating place to be.</p>
            <p>Love this quote "A mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone" by Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones. One of the biggest reasons why I happen to connect with a book is if/when I could relate to any of the major characters of the book. Fantasy, Mystery, Fiction, Adventure/Science Fiction, Historical/Period Drama and Thrillers are my favorite genres.</p>
            <p>I have too many of my favorite books to list. Listed below are a few books which I cherish most for different reasons. I happened to read each of them at different phases of my life starting from my childhood. Each of them has had a certain impact on my character, personality, my thought process and my values in life.</p>

            <h2><a name="AdventuresofTomSawyer">"Adventures of Tom Sawyer" by Mark Twain</a></h2>
        <p>Adventures of Tom Sawyer was the first ever novel I read in my childhood. It unveiled the adventurous streak in me. So glad to be living in the state (Missouri) where the author of this novel, Mark Twain grew up.</p>

        <h2><a name="Heidi">"Heidi" by Johanna Spyri</a></h2>
        <p> I read Heidi in my early teens. Loved the animated version of this story so much that I had an urge to read the book. It's the story of a little girl called Heidi who lives in Swiss Alps. My great love for nature, woods and mountains, snow and winters began then. A trip to Swiss Alps is one of my bucket list items now.</p>

        <h2><a name="SherlockHolmes-TheHoundofTheBaskervilles">"Sherlock Holmes - The Hound of The Baskervilles" by Sir. Arthur Conan Doyle</a></h2>
        <p>This one here gave me a bone-chilling and nail-biting experience. It is a gripping mystery thriller. I read this book in my mid teens and immediately took a liking for detective stories, mysteries and thrillers.</p>

        <h2><a name="HarryPotterSeries">"Harry Potter Series" by J.K. Rowling</a></h2>
        <p>I read The world famous Harry Potter series (set of seven books) through my late teens while I was pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. I must say, I was fascinated. That's when Fantasy and Fiction have become my all time favorite go-to genres. I enjoyed reading the books much more than watching their respective movie adaptations. Looking forward to visiting the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios, Orlando hopefully next year.</p>

        <h2><a name="ThePerksOfBeingAWallflower">"The Perks of Being A Wallflower" by Stephen Chbosky</a></h2>
        <p>This is a coming of age epistolary novel, a modern classic, I read in my early twenties which I thoroughly enjoyed. I could relate to one of the main characters in the book which is why it is one of the books that are close to my heart.</p>

        <h2><a name="PrideandPrejudice">"Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen</a></h2>
        <p>Pride and Prejudice is one such story that is capable of resisting the passage of time. Took a fancy to classics and period dramas ever since I experienced this book.</p>

        <h2><a name="NorthandSouth">"North and South" by Elizabeth Gaskell</a></h2>
        <p>I read this book recently. North and South is a social novel set in 1800's during the time of Industrial Revolution. I admired the plot as well as both the lead characters of this book a great deal. I can watch the BBC TV series 2004 adaptation of this book a zillion times.</p>
