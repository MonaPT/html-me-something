            <h1>MPriz's Reading Nook</h1>
            <p>I have too many favorite books to list. One of my favorite quotes about books is "A mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone" by Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones. One of the biggest reasons why I happen to fall in love with a book is if/when I could relate to any of the major characters of the book which are also inspiring.</p>
            <p>Listed below are a few books which I cherish most for different reasons. I happened to read each of them at different phases of my life starting from my childhood. Each of them has had a certain impact on my character, personality, my thought process and my values.</p>

        <h2><a name="AdventuresofTomSawyer">"Adventures of Tom Sawyer" by Mark Twain</a></h2>
        <p>Adventures of Tom Sawyer was the first ever novel I read in my childhood. It brought out the adventurous streak in me to light. So glad to be living in the state where the author of this novel, Mark Twain grew up.</p>

        <h2><a name="Heidi">"Heidi" by Johanna Spyri</a></h2>
        <p> I read Heidi in my early teens. Loved the animated version of this story so much that I had an urge to read the book. It's the story of a little girl called Heidi who lives in Alps. My love for nature began then. A trip to Swiss Alps in one of my bucket list.</p>
